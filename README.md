# Project Name: List Pagination and Filtering
## Project description 
  We will be given a list of students. Our objective is to dynamically organize and display 10 students per page, then generate as many links necessary to allocate the list of students in different pages. For example: if we have 33 students, we want to display 10 in the first page, then the next 10 in the second page and so on.
## Skills used:
- Basic to advanced DOM manipulation 
- Query Selector
- Create Element
- Append Child
- Arrow Functions
- Event listeners
-  
  
## Exceeds Expectations:
  To exceed the expectations we had to implement a search functionality. We had to add, using JS, a div container, a search input, and a button to submit. Using event listeners we had to filter through the list by name.
